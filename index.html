            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up"><strong>With exclusive rights and a global game plan, WBD is bringing every point of Roland-Garros to fans from the U.S to Europe &mdash; across Max, TNT Sports, Eurosport, and more.</strong></p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">When the world's best tennis players step onto the red clay at Paris’s Stade Roland-Garros on May 19, it will kick off one of the biggest sports moments of the year &mdash; and the beginning of a new era for the tournament and for Warner Bros. Discovery.</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">As one of the sport's four Grand Slams, Roland-Garros &mdash; also known as the French Open &mdash; is a crown jewel of the tennis world. And it’s never been more popular: last year, a record 675,000 fans attended in person, and tournament videos drew over 1 billion views on Eurosport social alone.</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">“Roland-Garros aligns perfectly with our commitment to growing TNT Sports,” says Chairman and CEO Luis Silberwasser about WBD’s exclusive U.S. live rights deal, signed last year, which extends through 2033. The agreement is in partnership with Eurosport, part of WBD Sports Europe, which has enjoyed a 36-year relationship with the French Tennis Federation.</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">With the deal, Roland-Garros joins <strong>NASCAR</strong>, the <strong>Champions League</strong>, <strong>MLB</strong>, and more as a marquee event in WBD’s new Season of Sport.</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">A mainstay of WBD’s strategy, Luis notes, is giving viewers “more live access than ever before,” and the French Open will be a shining example — drawing from TNT Sports’ NBA pedigree to engage both die-hard tennis fans and casual viewers with compelling narratives and premium production.</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up" style="margin-bottom: 0;">“Roland-Garros presents a great opportunity for us to showcase the strength of our entire global sports portfolio,” says Craig Barry, Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, TNT Sports. “We’re going to bring a fresh take on the presentation of tennis &mdash; appealing to both passionate and casual fans through powerful storytelling, unprecedented access, and unique perspectives from our esteemed on-air talent."</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">And there are fascinating stories to tell this year, says Aurelia Mounier, Director of Tennis at WBD Sports Europe. “Italy’s world number one Jannik Sinner is returning; Carlos Alcaraz is looking to defend his men’s title; Iga Swiatek is chasing her fourth straight win; Aryna Sabalenka is fighting for her first; and Novak Djokovic is aiming to surpass Margaret Court’s Grand Slam record.”</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">Coverage will include legends off the court as well — like Chris Evert, John McEnroe, Mats Wilander, Boris Becker, and Andre Agassi, the beloved 1999 Roland-Garros champion.</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">“We’ve assembled our greatest-ever lineup of Grand Slam champions and tennis experts &mdash; many appearing across U.S., U.K., and European productions,” says Scott Young, Group SVP, Content, Production & Business Operations.</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">But another star will be Paris itself, Aurelia says. “What sets us apart is how we bring a genuine flavour of Paris to fans,” she says. “We’ll be presenting from the alleys and grounds of Roland-Garros, with stars like Venus Williams joining our storytelling.”</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">Roland-Garros is more than just a tournament. Held in “the elegant and ancestral home of Eurosport,” as Scott notes, it’s a moment that blends athleticism and atmosphere &mdash; inspiring quixotic musings on tennis, Europe, and personal grit.</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">“Roland-Garros is where tennis legends are made,” says Katie Arkins, Vice President, Head of Programming Strategy, Bleacher Report. “We're giving fans a front-row seat to the clay-court battles, the behind-the-scenes moments, and the stories that make this tournament iconic.”</p>

            <div class="oi-rg__tennisBall oi-rg__tennisBall2">

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">The tournament also marks a big step in WBD’s own ascendance as a global powerhouse. With teams working across continents and time zones, the French Open will showcase the “One WBD” strategy in action &mdash; creating opportunities for brand integrations, including with major film franchises. (Superman cameo, anyone?)</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">Thanks to this global integration, tennis fans will be able to follow stars like Coco Gauff, Sabalenka, Alcaraz, and Djokovic through a fully integrated coverage experience. Featured matches will air on TNT Sports in the U.S. and U.K., as well as on Eurosport. truTV will offer studio and whiparound coverage, and Max will stream all 900 (!) matches live, with highlights and bonus content on Bleacher Report, House of Highlights, and HighlightHER.</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">“We’ll be the exclusive broadcaster in the U.S. and Europe (excluding France), with every match from every court on Max and discovery+, and more than 300 hours of live TV across Eurosport and TNT Sports,” says Scott, who lists the cross-Atlantic collaboration as one of the tournament’s biggest rewards. “Our 10-year U.S. deal deepens collaboration between our teams on both sides of the Atlantic. Working with Craig Barry and the TNT U.S. team lets us combine storytelling innovations with our unmatched channel portfolio. It’s going to elevate our coverage and reach.”</p>

            </div>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">In short, WBD’s coverage is unparalleled &mdash; and its global strategy is delivering results.</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">“Last year’s launch of Max in Europe helped increase paid streaming viewership by nearly 30 percent,” Aurelia notes. “We also saw television growth of almost 50 percent, with record editions in Poland, Italy, Germany, and the U.K. &mdash; powered by local heroes.”</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">It’s all part of WBD’s aim to meet fans where they are &mdash; TV, mobile, or anywhere in between. “That,” Luis says, “is something previous rights-holders didn’t do.”</p>

            <p class="wbd-gsap-trigger" data-duration="1.2" data-ease="power4.out" data-style="fade-in slide-in-up">The tournament is wide open &mdash; full of myth and mastery. Whatever happens on the court, one thing’s clear: Roland-Garros 2025 will raise WBD’s standing in global sports media and solidify its role as a world-class destination for fans.</p>
